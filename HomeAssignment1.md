### Gradient Descent
1. We need it because tells us how to adjust the model's weights to reduce the error (or loss). It shows the direction and rate of change of the loss with respect to each weight. 

2. The loss function tells us how far off the NN's predictions are from the actuall target value and how well or poor our model is doing so if we use a bad loss function the model can learn wrong patterns or even fail to improve meaningfully

### Neural Network Basics

### Embeddings
1. we use them to convert discrete, categorical inputs like words into continous vectors of numbers that capture useful information in order to allow the model to learn and also generalize better.
